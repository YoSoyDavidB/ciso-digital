# RISK ASSESSMENT REQUEST

## ASSET DETAILS
- ID: {asset_id}
- Name: {asset_name}
- Type: {asset_type}
- Criticality: {asset_criticality}
- Environment: {asset_environment}

## VULNERABILITIES ({vulnerabilities_count})
{vulnerabilities_list}

{rag_context_section}

## ASSESSMENT INSTRUCTIONS

Analyze the asset and vulnerabilities above to provide a comprehensive risk assessment.

Consider:
1. **Vulnerability Severity**: CVSS scores and exploitability
2. **Asset Criticality**: Business impact if compromised
3. **Attack Surface**: Exposure and accessibility
4. **Security Controls**: Existing protections mentioned in guidance
5. **Threat Context**: Known exploits and threat actor interest

Provide your assessment as a JSON object with this exact structure:

```json
{{
    "risk_score": <float between 0.0 and 10.0>,
    "severity": "<critical|high|medium|low|info>",
    "recommendations": [
        "<specific actionable recommendation 1>",
        "<specific actionable recommendation 2>",
        "<specific actionable recommendation 3>"
    ],
    "confidence": <float between 0.0 and 1.0>,
    "reasoning": "<detailed explanation of risk score and severity>"
}}
```

Ensure:
- risk_score accurately reflects combined risk from all vulnerabilities
- severity matches the risk_score range (critical: >=9.0, high: >=7.0, medium: >=4.0, low: >=1.0, info: <1.0)
- recommendations are specific, actionable, and prioritized
- confidence reflects certainty in the assessment
- reasoning explains the key factors driving the risk score

Respond ONLY with the JSON object, no additional text.
